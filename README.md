# orchard-fed-test-louel-lagasca
This is a Vite + React project for Filta's test purposes.

Used the following tools for development:
- Vite & React: Used for the build tool and front-end framework. Good for single page web applications, which is the scope of this test.
- Sass: Used as the CSS-preprocessor. I prefer traditional CSS and Sass has that with more advanced features. Also prefer the approach of writing styling in an external file, makes it easier to maintain.
- Motion/Framer Motion: A good animation library for modern web development. Easy to read, maintain, and implement.
